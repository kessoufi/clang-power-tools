# Clang Power Tools (for Visual Studio)

Clang Power Tools is a **free** _open-source_ Visual Studio extension helping Visual Studio C++ developers leverage Clang/LLVM tools (clang++, clang-tidy and clang-format), in order to perform various code transformations and fixes like modernizing code to C++ 11 / 14 / 17 and finding subtle latent bugs with its static analyzer and C++ Core Guidelines checks.

This project debuted at CppCon 2017, when we introduced the recently open-sourced project to the C++ community.
